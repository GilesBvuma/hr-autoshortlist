Because there being both candidates and users getting saved in this application both need their own tables
so we make a Candidate (Entity)table and a User(Entity) both with their own data 
A REST API is a specific type of API that uses HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources (like User, Product, Order), typically returning data in JSON or XML format.
So, "creating an API in Spring Boot" means using the Spring Boot framework to quickly and efficiently build a set of endpoints(eg {"/api/candidates"}) that other applications can call over HTTP to get, create, update, or delete data
The DispatcherServlet: This is the heart of Spring MVC. It receives all incoming requests and routes them to the correct controller method. You don't have to configure this yourself; Spring Boot does it automatically.

WIRING NOTES AND CONTROLLER -> SERVICE -> DTO MAPPING SUMMARY
------------------------------
Controller receives requests (e.g., ApplicationController.submitApplication) and converts multipart/form-data into parameters/MultipartFile objects.

Controller calls Service (ApplicationService.submitApplication) which:

validates job existence (via JobRepository)

stores files via FileStorageService

creates and saves the Application entity via ApplicationRepository.

JobController returns JobDTO so frontend receives only safe fields (no internal file paths).

When listing applications for HR, ApplicationController.getByJob returns Application entities — you can create an ApplicationDTO later to hide filenames or show file download URLs.
