Complete Request Flow Example
When Frontend calls GET /api/candidates:

React Frontend → HTTP GET request to /api/candidates

CandidateController.getAllCandidates() → Receives request

CandidateService.getAllCandidates() → Called by controller

CandidateRepository.findAll() → Called by service (auto-implemented by Spring Data JPA)
Database → SQL SELECT query executed

Database → Returns data to Repository

Repository → Returns List<Candidate> to Service

Service → Returns List<Candidate> to Controller

Controller → Returns JSON response to Frontend

React → Displays the candidate list

*🔗 How Everything Works Together (Flow Summary)
USER REGISTERS

AuthController → AuthService → UserRepository → DB

Password hashed using BCrypt

User saved

*USER LOGS IN

AuthController receives username/password

AuthService checks password

JwtUtil generates JWT

Controller returns token to client

*USER CALLS A PROTECTED ENDPOINT

React sends request: Authorization: Bearer <token>

JwtFilter intercepts request

JwtUtil validates token

CustomUserDetailsService loads user from DB

Spring Security authenticates request

Controller processes request
